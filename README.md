# SONAR-VS-ROCK-PREDICTION-
Overview
This repository contains code and resources for predicting whether an object detected underwater is a rock or a mine. Leveraging machine learning techniques, the project aims to analyze sonar signals and classify them as either rocks or mines. The dataset used for model training and testing is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Sonar dataset.

Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to showcase the practical application of machine learning algorithms for classification tasks, specifically within the domain of sonar signal analysis. By implementing and evaluating various machine learning models, the project endeavors to create a robust classifier capable of accurately distinguishing between rocks and mines based on sonar readings.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The project encompasses data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction from sonar signals to prepare the dataset for model training.
Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines, are implemented and evaluated to identify the most suitable approach for the classification task.
Model Selection: Through rigorous evaluation using performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, the project determines the optimal model for predicting rock vs. mine instances.
Model Deployment: The best-performing model is deployed for real-time prediction, enabling seamless integration into applications requiring underwater object classification.
